1) THE DATA 
The dataset is a time-series. How do I know? Because the target variable is a random variable, indexed by time (months in a year), across a few years, hintiong towards the possibility 
of cylicity/seasonality/ trend/ level...... 

2) THE MODEL

I intentionally decided to start with extremely basic statistical models. Probably not a great idea for setting a baseline, but I would genuinely like to explore via this, some intuitions 
that I have always had, regarding pre-computational era thinking (Kindly feel free to ignore, this is just something I obsess over).


2.1) Started with Rolling-Forecast:
Underlying assumptions-> 

2.1.1) Forecast= Trend+ Seasonality + Noise
2.1.2) Seasonality is additive in nature (could be multiplicative-> should be a test to check)
2.1.3) Contribution of all previous 12 months, is equal to the present month (Doesn't really happen in the domain of the project, but ok for setting a base.)
2.1.4) The model only takes into account the initial actual data, for prediction, rest all are based on maths, over actual data. 

2.2) Exponential Smoothing: I managed to explore the SES, DES, and TES methods.

2.2.1) Seasonality still assumed to be additive (except in case of TES).
2.2.2) SES-> Only the level of the series, is considered, and evaluated/forecasted. 
2.3.3) DES-> This considers both the Level of the series and the Trend. 
2.3.4) TES-> This considers all 3 variables, Level, Trend, and Seasonality (Forecast= (Level+Trend)* Seaonality+ Noise)


3) THE EVALUATION

3.1) MAE-> For measuring how far off prediction is from the actual data. 
3.2) DA-> Direction Accuracy 
3.3) RMSE-> I would want to punish the larger errors, as large deviations, have extremely significant effect.
